Nice work all around.

Question for you:  You duplicate a lot of code between "checkForWin" and "checkForX" - can you
think of a way to be more efficient about it?  What you have is functional but not good style.

One option: use "alternate" to decide which player won.
Another option: have checkForWin return something other than a boolean - maybe something that has several different possible values.

Well done overall.  Keep up the good work!
